# Twitter Stats App

# Use Python 3.2

# Code assumes headers have already been added to CSV file, or will be at a later date.

# Column headers should be as such, in the following order: handle, followers, tweets, favorites, friends, lists appears on.

# Type Python3 twitter_stats_app.py to run code

# When prompted to input twitterhandle, input the twitter handle. There is no need to write the @ symbol, as it's already included.
